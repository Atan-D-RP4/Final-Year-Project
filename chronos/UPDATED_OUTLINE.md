# Project outline — Multivariate Financial Forecasting with Chronos

Below is a detailed plan of the project (excluding the abstract) covering the idea, concrete use-cases & stakeholders, candidate datasets (with short Python retrieval snippets), research goals, evaluation plan, and how each goal would affect real applications.

---

# 1. Project idea (high level)

Build, adapt, and evaluate a **multivariate** version of Chronos (or Chronos-based pipelines) for financial forecasting and feature attribution.
Goals: (a) obtain reliable point & probabilistic forecasts on financial targets (indices, returns, volatility, macro indicators) using multiple covariates, (b) demonstrate measurable improvement over univariate baselines, (c) produce robust, interpretable feature-importance / attribution results so users can reason about which covariates drive predictions (e.g., interest rates → recession signal), and (d) evaluate real-world utility via backtests / scenario analysis.

Phases:

1. Data collection & preprocessing (multiple sources, mixed frequencies).
2. Baselines (univariate Chronos or ARIMA/LSTM) + multivariate Chronos (fine-tuning / adapter layers).
3. Experiments: accuracy, probabilistic calibration, regime robustness, transfer/zero-shot.
4. Attribution analyses (ablation, permutation, integrated gradients, counterfactuals).
5. Backtesting and user-facing outputs (signals, scenario simulator, reports).
6. Wrap up: applications, limitations, reproducibility.

# 2. Use cases, stakeholders, and applications

## Use cases (concrete)

* **Index & sector forecasting** — daily/weekly forecasts (returns, direction, volatility) for S&P500, sector indices.
* **Macro-financial forecasting** — forecasting GDP growth, unemployment, or recession probability using macro + market covariates.
* **Risk & volatility forecasting** — probabilistic forecasts of volatility (VaR, expected shortfall).
* **Cross-asset spillover forecasting** — how bond yields, FX, commodity moves affect equities.
* **Anomaly detection / monitoring** — detect unusual co-movements across indicators (early warning).
* **Scenario analysis / counterfactuals** — “if interest rates rise X bps, what’s the likely path for GDP or equity returns?”
* **Automated signal generation** — alerts for portfolio rebalancing, hedging, or tactical allocation.

## Stakeholders

* **Retail investors / advisor platforms:** simpler signals and interpreted reasons (with confidence intervals).
* **Economists / research desks:** macro trend forecasts and attribution for policy analysis.
* **Quants / quant funds:** short-horizon predictive signals integrated into trading strategies (needs low latency, robust evaluation).
* **Risk officers / asset allocators:** probabilistic risk forecasts and scenario stress tests.
* **Regulators / policymakers:** early warning indicators for systemic risk (with explainability).

## Applications (user-facing)

* **Dashboard**: multivariate forecasts + top contributing variables + scenario explorer.
* **Alerting service**: user subscribes to signals (e.g., “70% chance market down next week; drivers: rising yields + negative sentiment”).
* **Research toolkit**: reproducible experiments, ablation results, Granger causality tests for economists.
* **Backtest module**: convert forecasts into signals + evaluate hypothetical P&L after transaction costs.

# 3. Datasets (recommended) — what & how to fetch (short Python snippets)

> Note: some datasets are free APIs (Yahoo, FRED), others are research datasets or commercial (LOBSTER, WRDS, Bloomberg). Below are practical and widely accessible sources first.

### (A) Market price & fundamental series (daily OHLCV)

**Source:** Yahoo Finance (via `yfinance`)

```python
import yfinance as yf
tickers = ["SPY","AAPL","MSFT"]
df = yf.download(tickers, start="2010-01-01", end="2025-01-01", interval="1d", auto_adjust=True)
# df has MultiIndex columns when multiple tickers
```

### (B) Macroeconomic indicators (monthly/quarterly)

**Source:** FRED (via `fredapi`)

```python
from fredapi import Fred
fred = Fred(api_key="YOUR_FRED_API_KEY")
unrate = fred.get_series("UNRATE", observation_start="1990-01-01")
cpi = fred.get_series("CPIAUCSL", observation_start="1990-01-01")
```

### (C) Interest rates / yield curve data

* Treasury yields: FRED series (e.g., "DGS10" = 10-yr rate). Use `fredapi` as above.
* Swap rates: commercial vendors or Quandl.

### (D) News / sentiment (text → features)

* Datasets like FNSPID / FinMultiTime (research datasets include aligned news + prices). If not available directly, you can pull news via APIs (NewsAPI/AlphaSense) and compute sentiment.

```python
# Example: get headlines via newsapi (requires key)
from newsapi import NewsApiClient
newsapi = NewsApiClient(api_key='YOUR_KEY')
resp = newsapi.get_everything(q='inflation OR Fed', from_param='2024-01-01', language='en')
```

### (E) Limit Order Book / high-frequency (LOBSTER — paid/restricted)

* **LOBSTER** provides order-book raw data (for intraday testing). Requires registration and download. Use LOBSTER’s downloader or provided files.

### (F) Crypto / alternative assets

**Source:** CCXT (exchange APIs) or CoinGecko / Binance

```python
import ccxt, pandas as pd
ex = ccxt.binance()
ohlc = ex.fetch_ohlcv('BTC/USDT', timeframe='1h', since=ex.parse8601('2022-01-01T00:00:00Z'))
df = pd.DataFrame(ohlc, columns=["ts","open","high","low","close","vol"])
df['ts'] = pd.to_datetime(df['ts'], unit='ms')
```

### (G) Research multivariate datasets

* **FinMultiTime**, **FNSPID**, **ChronoGraph / ChronoGraph-like** — research datasets combining prices + news + other modalities. These often come as downloadable archives (ArXiv / project pages) — treat as batch downloads and parse into DataFrames.

### (H) Alternative: Kaggle datasets & WRDS

* **Kaggle**: multiple community datasets (intraday, historical returns). Use Kaggle API to download.

```bash
# shell: install kaggle and put kaggle.json in ~/.kaggle/
kaggle datasets download -d some/dataset-name
```

### Data preparation notes

* Align mixed frequencies: resample monthly → daily via forward-fill or include as separate calendar features.
* Create lags, percent changes, rolling stats (volatility), technical indicators.
* Carefully handle survivorship bias (for equities), corporate actions, and data revisions (macro data).

# 4. Research goals, experiments, and their effects on applications

Below are primary research goals and concrete experiments, with how success/failure affects each application.

## Goal A — Demonstrate multivariate Chronos improves forecasting accuracy vs univariate baseline

**Experiments**

* Train/evaluate: univariate Chronos (target history only) vs multivariate Chronos (target + covariates).
* Baselines: ARIMA/VAR, LSTM/TCN, classical factor models.
* Datasets: index returns, sector returns, GDP growth + market returns.

**Metrics**

* Point: MAE, RMSE; Directional accuracy (up/down).
* Probabilistic: CRPS, quantile loss; interval coverage.
* Economic: backtest Sharpe ratio, hit rate after accounting for transaction costs.

**Effect on applications**

* If successful → better signals for investors, more accurate risk forecasts for risk officers, credible macro predictions for economists.
* If improvement is marginal → the application should emphasize interpretability or scenario analysis rather than trying to be a primary trading signal.

---

## Goal B — Robustness across regimes (bull, bear, crisis)

**Experiments**

* Evaluate rolling-window performance across different regime labels (e.g., high VIX vs low VIX).
* Stress tests: simulate shocks (2008-like, COVID-like) by withholding those periods from training and testing generalization.

**Effect**

* Robust performance → suitable for institutional use/capital deployment; better trust for policy use.
* Fragile performance → limit application to advisory or research use only.

---

## Goal C — Probabilistic / calibrated forecasts (not just point)

**Experiments**

* Train to output full predictive distributions (quantiles, parametric distributions) and validate calibration (PIT, interval coverage).
* Compare point forecasts vs probabilistic: e.g. use value-at-risk backtests.

**Effect**

* Good calibration enables risk managers to set capital buffers and helps retail users understand uncertainty.
* Poor calibration means mis-estimated risk — dangerous for trading/portfolio decisions.

---

## Goal D — Feature attribution & causal checks (which variates matter)

**Attribution Experiments**

1. **Ablation study**: remove a covariate (interest rates) and measure drop in accuracy.
2. **Permutation importance**: shuffle a covariate’s time order and measure performance drop.
3. **Gradient-based / Integrated gradients**: compute sensitivity of predicted target to inputs (or attention weights).
4. **Counterfactuals**: feed scenarios (raise interest rates by X) and observe predicted target distributions.
5. **Classical causality check**: Granger causality on residuals / inputs as orthogonal check.

**Effect**

* If a covariate (e.g., interest rate) consistently shows high importance and causal tests support predictive power, economists can use it as an actionable indicator.
* If importance is context-dependent, the application must present conditional statements: “interest rates predict recession only in these regimes/contexts.”

---

## Goal E — Mixed frequency & missing data handling

**Experiments**

* Compare strategies: upsampling (ffill), hierarchical models, explicit masking, or interpolation vs models that accept mixed inputs natively.
* Test when macro monthly inputs are useful for daily forecasts and when they are not.

**Effect**

* Good mixed-frequency handling → broader applicability (macro + market combined).
* Poor handling → increase in noise; application should restrict to matching frequencies.

---

## Goal F — Efficiency & deployment (Bolt / adapters)

**Experiments**

* Measure inference latency and memory of full Chronos vs Bolt variants or adapter-based Chronos (ChronosX) for multivariate inputs.
* Test tradeoffs between speed and accuracy.

**Effect**

* Low latency variant → usable for intraday trading / alerts.
* Heavy models → best reserved for overnight batch forecasts and research.

---

# 5. Evaluation / validation protocols (practical)

* **Walk-forward / rolling evaluation** with no look-ahead.
* **Backtesting** with transaction costs, slippage, and realistic execution assumptions.
* **Stratified evaluation** by regime (low/high vol, pre/post crises).
* **Calibration tests** for probabilistic outputs (PIT histograms, interval coverage).
* **Statistical significance**: Diebold-Mariano tests for forecast comparison.
* **Robustness checks**: feature noise injection, missingness experiments, out-of-sample geographies (e.g., train US, test EU).

---

# 6. Deliverables & user artifacts

* **Reproducible code** (data preprocessing, training loops, evaluation).
* **Benchmarks**: tables/plots comparing univariate vs multivariate across datasets.
* **Feature attribution reports**: per-target importance ranking + counterfactual scenarios.
* **Dashboard prototype**: forecasts + top drivers + scenario simulator.
* **Paper / technical report**: experiments, methods, limitations.

---

# 7. Example experiment matrix (concise)

* **Targets**: S&P500 daily returns, VIX, quarterly GDP growth.
* **Covariate groups**: interest rates (short & long), inflation, cross-asset returns, sentiment, volatility, technical indicators.
* **Models**: univariate Chronos, multivariate Chronos (fine-tuned), ARIMA/VAR, LSTM.
* **Metrics**: RMSE, direction accuracy, CRPS, backtest Sharpe.
* **Attribution**: ablation + permutation + integrated gradients + Granger.

---

# 8. How to interpret “interest rate → recession” within this framework

* Use combined evidence: model attribution (e.g., integrated gradients shows interest rates have high influence for horizon 4–8 quarters) + ablation (removing yields reduces recession forecasting AUC) + Granger tests (interest rate changes Granger-cause GDP drops) + counterfactuals (simulate rate hike and compute effect on predicted GDP).
* If all methods converge → stronger evidence that interest rates are predictive in your datasets & regime. If results are mixed → the conclusion must be conditional: e.g., “rate rises predict recession primarily when the yield curve is inverted and inflation is above X.”

---

# 9. Risks, limitations & mitigations

* **Overfitting**: mitigate with regularization, early stopping, cross-validation, fewer features, and heavy out-of-sample testing.
* **Spurious correlations**: use multiple attribution methods + causality tests + economic plausibility.
* **Regime shifts**: include regime-aware evaluation and domain adaptation experiments.
* **Data quality & survivorship bias**: use full historical universe, correct for corporate actions, and check for data lags/revisions.
* **Ethical/regulatory**: be transparent about uncertainty and avoid promising guaranteed returns.
