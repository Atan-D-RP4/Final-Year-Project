Final Year Project
## Initial Project Ideas:
- Building an ML/DL model capable of distinguishing AI-generated and Human-written content on the Internet and provide it as web-service.
- Building an ML/DL service that separates the various sounds of a song such as the vocals, guitar instrumentals, 
piano notes, etc into separate sample tracks.
- Researching the use of ML models, in contexts outside of their typical use
case. Like using Time-Series Forecasting models on System and Network logs to identify anomalies and intrusions, 
or in Genetic Sequencing domains, to map gene sequences to biological features and predicting mutations and their effects.
- An sophisticated Meeting summarizer facilitated by modern LLM technologies.
