# Research Proposal Overview: Multivariate Financial Forecasting with Chronos (plus Application Fall-Back)

## Multivariate Financial Forecasting and Attribution with Chronos: Zero-Shot & Tokenization Strategies, using an Application Engine

## Background & Motivation

- Time-series foundation models (such as Chronos) have shown strong performance
  in forecasting tasks, but most evaluations focus on univariate or
  domain-specific data.
- In finance, market dynamics depend on multiple covariates (macroeconomics,
  interest rates, volatility, sentiment, cross-asset behavior). There is a gap
  in research assessing whether foundation models generalize well to
  **multivariate financial data**, especially in zero-shot or few-shot settings,
  and whether we can reliably identify which features drive performance.
- The ability to forecast not just numbers but probabilities and directions with
  explanations has value to economists, investors, policy makers. Even if
  certain research objectives (e.g. perfect causal attribution) are hard,
  building a usable application/engine can serve as fallback: delivering
  forecasting + interpretability to users.

## Objectives

1. **Zero-Shot Financial Forecasting** Investigate whether pretrained Chronos /
   Chronos-Bolt can forecast multivariate financial time-series (e.g. index
   returns, GDP, bond yields) *without fine-tuning*, and compare performance to
   fine-tuned and univariate baselines.

2. **Tokenization / Quantization Strategy for Financial Covariates** Design and
   implement strategies to convert multivariate financial signals (interest
   rates, inflation, macro indicators, technical features, sentiment) into
   tokenized inputs compatible with Chronos-Bolt’s quantization architecture,
   preserving dynamic / sequential information.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation & Attribution** Build an evaluation framework
   spanning continuous forecasts, directional/classification outputs,
   probabilistic calibration, and regime robustness. Also conduct feature
   attribution experiments (ablation, perturbation, gradient/attention/SHAP
   etc.) to determine which covariates contribute most, and in what regimes.

4. **Application Engine as Fallback & Deliverable** Build a prototype
   application (dashboard + signal API) that uses the developed multivariate
   forecasting model and attribution insights. If research parts underperform,
   the application still delivers value by providing forecasts, explanations,
   and scenario tools using the best model from research.

## Research Questions / Hypotheses

- *RQ1:* How well does Chronos / Chronos-Bolt pretrained on generic time-series
  transfer to multivariate financial data in zero-shot settings?
- *RQ2:* Which tokenization & feature engineering methods for financial
  covariates yield best improvements over univariate or naive multivariate
  inputs?
- *RQ3:* Which covariates (interest rates, inflation, etc.) are consistently
  predictive across markets & regimes? Are these signals stable or
  regime-dependent?
- *RQ4:* Is probabilistic forecasting (with well-calibrated intervals) feasible
  in multivariate settings, and more useful to end-users than point forecasts?
- *Hypothesis:* Interest rate rises are predictive of economic downturns only
  when certain other covariates (yield curves, inflation, sentiment) are in
  specific states — i.e. the signal is conditional.

| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Datasets** | - Historical stock indices, bond yields, volatility indices from Yahoo Finance / Quandl <br> - Macro indicators (GDP, CPI, interest rates, unemployment) via FRED / IMF / World Bank <br> - Sentiment or news indices if available <br> - Cross-asset data (commodities, FX) as covariates |
| **Preprocessing & Tokenization** | - Aligning different frequencies (daily, monthly) <br> - Normalizing / scaling <br> - Quantization / binning / vocabulary mapping <br> - Generating lagged features, moving averages, rolling statistics |
| **Models** | - Univariate baseline models (ARIMA, univariate Chronos) <br> - Multivariate Chronos (fine-tuned) <br> - Zero-shot Chronos (pretrained) with tokenized financial inputs <br> - Possibly other deep models for comparison (LSTM, TCN, VAR) |
| **Evaluation** | - Continuous metrics: RMSE, MAE, MASE, sMAPE, quantile loss <br> - Probabilistic metrics: CRPS, interval coverage, calibration <br> - Classification/directional metrics: Accuracy, F1, AUC for up/down or recession prediction <br> - Regime-based evaluation (high vol vs low vol, crisis periods) <br> - Attribution experiments: ablation, permutation, gradient/attention, scenario perturbation <br> - Backtesting or P&L simulation (if applicable) |

## Applications & Stakeholders (Deliverable Side)

Even if research does not fully validate all hypotheses, the application engine
as fallback will deliver:

- A **dashboard** showing multivariate forecasts for selected targets (e.g.
  equity index returns, bond yields, GDP growth)
- **Feature importance** explanations for each forecast (which covariates most
  influenced prediction)
- Ability to run **scenario simulations** (e.g. “if interest rates rise 100bps”,
  “inflation doubles”, etc.)
- Alerts/signals for market direction or risk metrics (for investors, advisors)
- Reporting tools for economists / policy analysts: historical attribution
  (which variables were most predictive) + forecast distributions

Stakeholders: retail/institutional investors; economists; policy organizations;
risk teams in corporations; academic users.

## Expected Outcomes & Success Criteria

| Success Criterion | What indicates success | Real-world effect |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Zero-shot multivariate forecasts approach fine-tuned / baseline performance (within some margin) | RMSE or other forecast error within, say, 10-20% of fine-tuned version; good directional accuracy | Users get usable forecast even without domain-specific training; less overhead/time to deploy |
| Tokenization methods improve performance vs naive pipelines | Quantifiable gain in forecast accuracy / calibration metrics when using engineered tokenization vs raw input | More robust model ingests varied financial inputs easily; sharing / reuse of tokenization pipelines |
| Attribution identifies stable covariates | Covariate importance for interest rates etc. that persist across markets and time; consistent across attribution methods | Economists / users can trust which indicators matter; better decision support |
| Application prototype is usable | Usability (UI or API), speed, clarity of explanations; feedback from stakeholders shows value | Even if research hypotheses don't all hold, app is usable for forecasting, signals, scenario work |

______________________________________________________________________

## Risks, Fallbacks & Mitigation

- If **zero-shot forecasting** is weak: fallback is to rely on fine-tuned models
  or hybrid models that use minimal domain-specific data. The engine will then
  use those as default.
- If tokenization strategy underperforms: fallback to simpler feature pipelines
  or traditional statistical models, but still provide forecasts.
- If attribution is inconsistent: deliver only descriptive insights (“in this
  period, these variables seemed most predictive”) rather than strong causal
  claims; include uncertainty.

______________________________________________________________________

## Budget, Resources & Requirements

- Compute resources: GPU/TPU access for training/fine-tuning Chronos models,
  storage for datasets.
- Data access: subscriptions or APIs for sentiment/news data (if needed).
- Personnel: research lead, possibly ML engineer / data engineer, UI/UX for
  application prototype.
- Software tools: Python ML stack, Chronos framework, tokenization libraries,
  dashboard frameworks (e.g. Streamlit / Dash).
