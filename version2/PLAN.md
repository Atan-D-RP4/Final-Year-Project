# Implementation plan — Multivariate Financial Forecasting with Chronos

*(Application as fallback deliverable; research-first but pragmatic and
product-minded.)*

Below is a detailed, actionable implementation plan you can follow. It’s
organised into ordered phases (with objectives, concrete tasks, deliverables,
success criteria, risks & mitigations), plus technical architecture,
modules/APIs, datasets & retrieval snippets, evaluation protocol, experiment
matrix, and deployment considerations. I intentionally **do not** promise to run
or deliver anything later — this is a plan you can implement or hand to
collaborators.

______________________________________________________________________

# 1. High-level approach & project structure

**Goal:** Build a research-capable codebase + prototype app that (a) explores
zero-shot / few-shot multivariate forecasting using Chronos/Chronos-Bolt, (b)
develops tokenization / quantization strategies for financial covariates, (c)
implements robust evaluation + attribution pipelines, and (d) produces a usable
forecasting/explanation application as a fallback deliverable.

**High-level phases (ordered):**

1. Project bootstrap & infra
2. Data collection & cleaning
3. Tokenization & feature engineering
4. Baselines & zero-shot experiments
5. Fine-tuning / adapter experiments
6. Attribution & causality analysis
7. Robustness, regime & backtesting
8. Application & dashboard (fallback deliverable)
9. Documentation, reproducibility & write-up

# 2. Phase-by-phase plan

> For each phase: Objective → Concrete tasks → Deliverables → Success criteria →
> Key risks & mitigations.

## Phase 0 — Project bootstrap & infra

**Objective:** Create reproducible environment, repo structure, compute access,
and dataset registry.

**Tasks**

- Initialize Git repository with clear structure (`data/`, `src/`, `notebooks/`,
  `experiments/`, `app/`, `docs/`).
- Create Python virtualenv / conda env and `requirements.txt` /
  `environment.yml`.
- Provision compute (GPU for fine-tuning; CPU for preprocessing). Decide on
  local vs cloud.
- Setup experiment tracking (Weights & Biases / MLflow) and basic CI checks
  (linting, small unit tests).
- Define coding style & contribution guidelines.

**Deliverables**

- Repo skeleton, env files, experiment tracking configured.
- Small smoke test demonstrating data fetch + model inference pipeline runs
  end-to-end.

**Success criteria**

- Reproducible environment that runs a minimal pipeline (download sample data,
  preprocess, call Chronos model inference).

**Risks / mitigations**

- *Risk:* Lack of GPU. *Mitigation:* Use Chronos-Bolt for CPU/low GPU
  experiments; start with small sample datasets.

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 1 — Data collection & cleaning

**Objective:** Assemble multi-domain datasets (market prices, yields, macro,
sentiment) and create a canonical time-aligned dataset store.

**Tasks**

- Define target variables (e.g., S&P500 returns, VIX, GDP growth, 10-yr yield).
- Write data fetch scripts (modular) for each source.
- Clean data: fix missing values, corporate actions, timezone alignment.
- Implement frequency alignment tools (resample daily/monthly/quarterly with
  clear rules).
- Create a dataset registry and small sample subsets for quick iteration.

**Deliverables**

- `data_pipeline/` scripts; saved cleaned datasets in `data/cleaned/`.
- README describing data schema and alignment rules.

**Success criteria**

- For each target, a clean, aligned DataFrame ready for tokenization and
  experiments.

**Sample retrieval snippets** (to include in repo):

```python

# market prices via yfinance
import yfinance as yf
symbols = ["^GSPC","^VIX","^TNX"]  # S&P500, VIX, US 10yr yield index placeholder
df_prices = yf.download(symbols, start="2010-01-01", interval="1d", auto_adjust=True)

# macro via FRED (requires API key)
from fredapi import Fred
fred = Fred(api_key="YOUR_FRED_API_KEY")
cpi = fred.get_series("CPIAUCSL", observation_start="1990-01-01")
dgs10 = fred.get_series("DGS10", observation_start="1990-01-01")

```

**Risks / mitigations**

- *Risk:* API limits / missing historical coverage. *Mitigation:* Cache raw
  dumps; use multiple data sources; prepare synthetic fallback datasets.

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 2 — Tokenization & feature engineering

**Objective:** Design pipeline(s) that convert multivariate financial inputs
into token sequences compatible with Chronos-Bolt quantization architecture (and
into numeric tensors for other models).

**Tasks**

- Prototype `FinancialDataTokenizer` (sliding window, normalization,
  quantization).

- Implement multiple quantization strategies:

  - uniform binning per variable,
  - percentile/quantile binning,
  - learned codebook (k-means on feature distribution).

- Produce token schema that records (var_id, bin_id, time_idx) or fused token
  for multi-var snapshot.

- Implement feature engineering primitives: lags, rolling means/vols, returns,
  yield spreads, curve slope.

- Provide export formats: token sequence for Chronos, numeric arrays for other
  models.

**Deliverables**

- `src/preprocessing/tokenizer.py` with classes:

  - `FinancialDataTokenizer`
  - `AdvancedTokenizer` (feature engineering + quantile / kmeans binning)

- Unit tests for tokenizer (round-trip checks, coverage).

**Success criteria**

- Tokenizer produces consistent token sequences from raw inputs and supports
  reconstructing approximate numeric values from tokens (sanity check).

**Risks / mitigations**

- *Risk:* Tokenization loses predictive info. *Mitigation:* Compare multiple
  strategies; keep a numeric baseline.

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 3 — Baselines & zero-shot experiments

**Objective:** Implement baseline univariate and multivariate pipelines and
evaluate zero-shot performance of pretrained Chronos/Chronos-Bolt on tokenized
financial inputs.

**Tasks**

- Implement classic baselines:

  - ARIMA/ETS (univariate),
  - VAR (multivariate)

- Implement neural baselines:

  - LSTM/TCN models accepting numeric arrays
  - Univariate Chronos (if accessible) for point of comparison

- Integrate Chronos-Bolt inference calling code that accepts tokens (zero-shot
  mode: directly feed tokenized financial sequences to pretrained Chronos
  without fine-tuning).

- Build evaluation harness that computes metrics (RMSE, MASE, CRPS, directional
  accuracy).

**Deliverables**

- `src/models/` with baseline implementations and wrapper for Chronos inference.
- Notebook `notebooks/zero_shot_experiments.ipynb` showing zero-shot results on
  at least two targets.

**Success criteria**

- Clear numeric comparisons: zero-shot Chronos vs univariate/multivariate
  baselines on held-out windows.

**Risks / mitigations**

- *Risk:* Pretrained Chronos API mismatch with tokens. *Mitigation:* Have
  numeric baseline as fallback; implement intermediate adapters if needed.

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 4 — Fine-tuning & adapter experiments

**Objective:** Fine-tune Chronos (or train adapter layers) on financial data and
measure improvements over zero-shot and baselines.

**Tasks**

- Implement a `ChronosFinancialForecaster` class with methods:

  - `forecast_zero_shot()`
  - `fine_tune(train_data, val_data, adapter_config)`
  - `evaluate(test_data)`

- Experiment with adapter architectures:

  - small adapter layers / prefix-tuning / ChronosX-style adapters (if
    supported).

- Hyperparameter search and early-stopping.

- Record and compare model sizes, inference latency.

**Deliverables**

- Fine-tuned model checkpoints stored with metadata.
- Experiment logbook (tracking metrics, hyperparams).

**Success criteria**

- Fine-tuned Chronos (or adapters) demonstrate consistent improvement over
  zero-shot baseline on at least one target (direction or RMSE).

**Risks / mitigations**

- *Risk:* Overfitting on small financial datasets. *Mitigation:* Use
  cross-validation, regularization, data augmentation (noise injection), early
  stopping.

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 5 — Attribution & causality analysis

**Objective:** Quantify which covariates drive predictions; test causal
hypotheses (e.g., interest rate rises → recession signal).

**Tasks**

- Implement AttributionEngine with methods:

  - `ablation_importance(model, data, covariate)` (leave-one-out)
  - `permutation_importance(model, data, covariate)`
  - `gradient_attribution(model, data)` (for differentiable models)
  - `shap_analysis(model, data)` wrapper if model supports SHAP
  - `counterfactual_simulation(model, data, scenario_func)`

- Run Granger causality tests / VAR impulse response analysis as a statistical
  complement.

- Design case studies: interest rate hikes → GDP/adverse equity returns; compute
  AUC/ROC for recession prediction with and without rates.

**Deliverables**

- `src/analysis/attribution.py`
- Attribution reports (tables + plots) per target and per regime.
- Case study notebook: interest rates vs recession forecasting.

**Success criteria**

- Consistent attribution signal across multiple methods for at least one
  covariate-target pair (e.g., yields → GDP or yields → equity drawdowns), or
  clearly documented conditionality.

**Risks / mitigations**

- *Risk:* Attribution disagreement between methods. *Mitigation:* Present
  ensemble of attribution outcomes and contextualize (regime-dependence).

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 6 — Robustness, regime & backtesting

**Objective:** Stress-test models across regimes and simulate downstream
application performance (e.g., trading/backtest or policy signal).

**Tasks**

- Implement walk-forward evaluation with rolling windows (no look-ahead).
- Define regime labels (e.g., high-vol vs low-vol; pre/post-crisis), evaluate
  stratified performance.
- Backtest simple strategies driven by model signals with realistic transaction
  costs and slippage (for investor-facing use cases).
- Test handling of missing data, noisy features, and distributional shift.

**Deliverables**

- `src/eval/walk_forward.py`, backtesting scripts, robustness reports.
- Decision thresholds and recommended operational constraints.

**Success criteria**

- Model exhibits acceptable, stable performance in at least one regime; or app
  contains explicit guardrails (e.g., only provide advisory signals, not
  automated trading) if performance is volatile.

**Risks / mitigations**

- *Risk:* Model collapses in crisis periods. *Mitigation:* Fallback to
  conservative rule-based policies in app; label outputs with confidence
  intervals and regime flags.

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 7 — Application & dashboard (fallback deliverable)

**Objective:** Build a user-facing prototype (dashboard + simple API) that exposes forecasts, top contributing variables, and scenario simulator.

**Tasks**

- Design minimal API: endpoints for `get_forecast(target, horizon)`, `get_explanation(target, horizon)`, `simulate_scenario(scenario_spec)`.

- Implement dashboard (Streamlit / Dash / FastAPI + simple frontend) that shows:

  - Forecast plot with prediction intervals
  - Top-k contributing covariates (ablation / SHAP)
  - Scenario builder (e.g., +100bps rates), returns simulated forecast trajectories
  - Backtesting results & warnings

- Package models into deployable units (Docker containers). Use Bolt/efficient variant for low-latency inference where possible.

**Deliverables**

- `app/` code; Docker image; user manual.
- Demo with sample datasets.

**Success criteria**

- App runs locally or on a small cloud instance and produces forecasts + explanations in <interactive session latency acceptable for users> (note: choose Bolt model for speed).

**Risks / mitigations**

- *Risk:* Heavy model slow in app. *Mitigation:* Serve smaller model for app; run heavy experiments offline and surface precomputed results.

______________________________________________________________________

## Phase 8 — Documentation, reproducibility & write-up

**Objective:** Produce final reports, reproducible notebooks, and packaging for
submission / handover.

**Tasks**

- Write technical report covering methods, experiments, and ethical
  considerations.
- Produce README, reproducible notebooks, and experiment manifests.
- Prepare presentation / appendices for code review.

**Deliverables**

- Technical report, reproducible archive (data pointers + seed + env), slides.

**Success criteria**

- Third-party can reproduce key experiments with given env & data access
  instructions.

# 4. Evaluation protocol & metrics

**Forecasting (continuous):**

- MAE, RMSE, MASE, sMAPE
- Probabilistic: CRPS, quantile loss, interval coverage (e.g., 90% CI coverage)

**Forecasting (classification / directional):**

- Accuracy, F1-score, ROC AUC, Precision/Recall

**Economic metrics (if backtesting):**

- Annualized return, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, turnover, transaction costs
  included

**Statistical tests:**

- Diebold–Mariano for forecast comparison
- Granger causality p-values, VAR impulse responses

**Robustness checks:**

- Stratified results by regime (high vol vs low vol)
- Sensitivity to noise / missingness injection

______________________________________________________________________

# 5. Experiment matrix (concise)

- **Targets:** S&P500 daily returns, VIX daily, GDP quarterly growth, 10-yr
  yield
- **Covariate groups:** interest rates (short & long), inflation, unemployment,
  cross-asset returns (commodities, FX), sentiment indices
- **Models:** zero-shot Chronos, fine-tuned Chronos (adapters), univariate
  Chronos baseline, LSTM, VAR, simple ARIMA
- **Tokenizers:** uniform bins, quantile bins, learned kmeans codebook
- **Evaluations:** rolling windows, backtest with transaction costs, attribution
  ensemble

Run systematic combinations and record results in structured experiment tables
(experiment ID, model, tokenizer, dataset, seed, metrics).

______________________________________________________________________

# 6. Data & compute resources (practical notes)

**Data**

- Store cleaned datasets in a versioned storage (DVC or simple S3 + manifest).
- Cache raw downloads to avoid repeated API calls.

**Compute**

- For quick iterations, start with Chronos-Bolt (efficient). Use a small GPU for
  adapter fine-tuning; full Chronos (large) may need high-memory GPU or
  multi-GPU.
- For production app, use Bolt or distilled/fine-tuned small variants to keep
  latency manageable.

**Personnel**

- 1 researcher/lead (methodology + experiments), 1 ML engineer (model infra +
  app), optionally 1 data engineer for large-scale data ingestion.

______________________________________________________________________

# 7. Deployment & app considerations (fallback mindset)

- **Model serving:** Use FastAPI + Uvicorn + Gunicorn + Docker. Serve Bolt model
  for interactive queries; allow batch jobs to run heavier fine-tuned models.
- **Safety & disclaimers:** Include clear user-facing disclaimers on uncertainty
  and non-guarantee of returns; show prediction intervals and regime flags.
- **Access control:** Provide user roles (researcher vs casual user); restrict
  heavy endpoints to authenticated users.
- **Logging & monitoring:** Log inputs/outputs, monitor model drift, and record
  feedback for future retraining.
- **Licensing & compliance:** Ensure data licenses permit distribution
  (especially third-party paid data).

______________________________________________________________________

# 8. Example minimal API surface (for the app)

```

GET /forecast?target=SPX&horizon=5  -> returns median forecast + intervals + top features
POST /simulate -> body: {scenario: [{var:"DGS10",delta:100}], horizon:12} -> returns simulated trajectories
GET /explain?target=SPX&horizon=5 -> returns feature importance table (ablation/permutation)
POST /backtest -> body: {strategy_spec} -> returns backtest metrics

```

______________________________________________________________________

# 9. Success criteria & go/no-go checkpoints

Build checkpoints (milestone gates) where you evaluate whether to proceed
research-first vs pivot to app-first:

- **Checkpoint A (data + tokenization ready):** If tokenized inputs preserve
  signal and produce reasonable baseline performance → continue research track.
- **Checkpoint B (zero-shot viability):** If zero-shot Chronos achieves
  acceptable baseline performance on at least one target → strong research
  signal; continue exploring adapters.
- **Checkpoint C (fine-tuning payoff):** If fine-tuning/adapters meaningfully
  improve and attribution is consistent → pursue publication / deeper research.
- **Fallback:** If research fails to show clear generalization, pivot to
  building the application around the best-performing baseline models and
  emphasize practical utility (dashboard, scenario tools, explanations).

*(These are decision checkpoints you can define and use — I did not attach time
constraints to them.)*

______________________________________________________________________

# 10. Next practical step (immediately actionable)

1. **Initialize repo** with directory structure above and add README + env file.
2. **Implement Phase 0 smoke test**: small script that fetches 2-3 series
   (S&P500, 10-yr yield, CPI), runs `FinancialDataTokenizer` (a basic
   implementation you supply), and calls Chronos-Bolt inference (or a
   placeholder model) to produce a forecast plot. This validates the end-to-end
   plumbing.
